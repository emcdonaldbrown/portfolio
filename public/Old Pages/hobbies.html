                Having not had much free time over the past few years, my hobbies and interests have become greatly reduced. However, two that I have managed to continue with are horse riding and gaming.

                <h2>World of Warcraft</h2>
                
                I have played Wow since it's launch in 2004. My first character was a human warlock, named Bellefire, and she is still my main character today.

                I started playing as my mum needed a new game to play, after completing Baulder's Gate, and a guy from work suggested a new online multiplayer game, that was just about to launch. Mum didn't want to play on her own, and so roped me in too. Along with my auntie, we've been playing ever since.

                Since 2008, I have been GM of a guild named Demise, on Ghostlands server. The guild started off as a family guild, with ten members of my family having their characters in there. As the years have passed, quite a few have stopped playing and so we began recruiting for new members around July this year. As a result, we have recently started heroic raiding, and have over 200 active members. The guild still has that 'family' feel, and we have a great group of players. Some of the members are friends from way back when, having known them in-game since around 2004. We are currently in the process of arranging our first guild meet up.

                <h2>Horse Riding</h2>
                
                <p>
                I have been horse riding since the age of 15. I bought my first horse when I was 21 years old; a chestnut mare named Hannah, and I still own her today. She is now 25 years old, and is all but retired. She does behave like a 6 year old sometimes, and still enjoys a blast across the stubble fields. 
                </p>

                <p>
                In 2009, Hannah's foal was born, and I named him Axel. He has extremely good breeding as his sire, Lord Luis, was a top showjumper. Unfortunately, Luis was put to sleep, after developing complications as the result of a routine operation.

                In 2010, I fell from Hannah while doing cross country, breaking the L4, L5 and S1 disks in my spine. After months of recuperation, I was able to start to ride again. However, as time has passed, I have developed facit joint arthritis in those disk and this has impeded my ability to ride and compete. I still manage to do some showjumping, but mainly stick to hacking out and dressage now.
