                I love the crisp mornings, getting wrapped up, scarves and gloves and cosy coats, and jumping in leaf piles.

                I enjoy taking our children, Sherratt and Arrabella, pumpkin picking. Then we spend an evening carving them into whatever it is that they're into at the moment. We have had everything from ninja turtles to Rapunzel. I look forward to Samhain, and get togethers with friends, spiced lattes and parkin, and taking the children trick-or-treating in their costumes.

                After Samhain comes Bonfire Night, which means a family get together with fireworks, baked potatoes, and pie and peas. Snuggly blankets, wooly hats, wellingtons and two pairs of socks are a must!

                Once Bonfire Night is over, we start preparing for Christmas. This year, Christmas will come a little earlier, as we have booked a trip to Lapland to see Father Christmas. Everyone is so excited!

                We have all handmade, original decorations on our Christmas Tree, and add to these each year. The children love going and picking out a tree, then we spend the evening decorating it while watching Christmas films and drinking hot chocolate.

                Another annual tradition is to take the children ice skating to the outdoor rink, then getting warm by drinking hot chocolate with marshmallows. Afterwards, we take a trip around the small gift shop and the children pick out presents for their Nan.

                We also have a visit from Father Christmas' elf, Briony. She visits to tell the children whether thay have been put on the good list or the naughty list. I'm dreading when they get too old for these little traditions.

                I handmake, with Sherratt and Arrabella, a lot of the presents we give, as I think this makes them extra special. This year we are making spa sets with bath bombs, scrubbies, candles and hand made chocolates and gin.

                We normally take a trip just after Christmas, off the grid somewhere, to chill out before everyone goes back to work and school. This year we are off to Scotland for a few days.
